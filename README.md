# Lucid

Lucid is an iOS app designed to ensure you truly wake up by requiring you to answer questions correctly before disabling the alarm. Perfect for heavy sleepers or those who tend to snooze their alarms without fully waking up.

## Technical Details

### Architecture & Design

Lucid is built using:
- Swift and SwiftUI for the user interface
- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture for clean separation of concerns
- UserDefaults for persistent storage of alarm settings
- Local notifications for alarm functionality
- System sounds for alarm audio

The app follows a modular design with:
- **Models**: Data structures for alarms and questions
- **Views**: SwiftUI components for the user interface
- **ViewModels**: Business logic connecting models and views
- **Managers**: Service classes for specific functionality (alarms, sounds, questions)

### Core Components

- **AlarmManager**: Handles scheduling, triggering, and managing alarms
- **QuestionGenerator**: Creates and validates different types of questions
- **SoundManager**: Manages alarm sound selection and playback
